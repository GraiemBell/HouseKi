  <h1>Lattice üíé</h1>
  <strong>A lightweight, modular, and extendable 3D game engine built for the web.</strong>
</div>

## ü§î Motivation

The web has a lot of independently awesome libraries for building games, but combining them all together can be a pain. Lattice aims to be a lightweight game framework for combining these libraries together - all while maintaining high performance via an Entity Component System (ECS), multi-threading using WebWorkers, and WebAssembly. Add physics or networking only if you need it, or add custom rendering components to suit your specific needs.

## üèóÔ∏è Design Goals

- **Lightweight**: The engine is designed to be lightweight, aiming to be a minimal wrapper around the underlying technologies. We want to avoid adding unnecessary abstractions.
- **Modular**: The engine is designed to be modular, allowing you to pick and choose which systems you want to use.
- **Extendable**: The engine is designed to be extendable, allowing you to easily add your own systems and components.
- **Isolated**: The engine is designed for running multiple isolated scenes in parallel, allowing for the safe execution of untrusted code.
- **High Performance**: The engine is designed to be high performance, achieved through the use of an ECS architecture, WASM scripting, and WebWorkers.
